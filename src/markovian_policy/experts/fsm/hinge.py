"""Hinge subtask: open the right hinge-cabinet door by side-grasping its handle.

Phases (each entered purely from the current obs, so the FSM is Markovian):
    move-to-pre-grasp -> move-to-grasp -> grasp -> open -> release
    -> post-release -> return-to-home

This is the microwave subtask mirrored (see microwave.py): the door is a vertical
handle bar that swings about a *vertical* axis, opened by hooking the bar (a world-z
yaw swings a finger behind it for form closure) and dragging it along its hinge arc.
The two differences from the microwave are:
  * the door opens the *other* way -- `rightdoorhinge` (qpos[21], range 0..1.57)
    grows *positive* to the D4RL goal 1.45, so the pull tangent and the hook yaw
    are flipped in sign;
  * the handle sits high (world z~2.6, out of reach), so -- like the slide -- we
    grasp low on the bar at a reachable WORK_Z (the bar spans z~2.44..2.76).

"""Microwave subtask: open the door by side-grasping its vertical handle bar.

Phases (each entered purely from the current obs, so the FSM is Markovian):
    move-to-pre-grasp -> move-to-grasp -> grasp -> open -> release
    -> post-release -> return-to-home

The open phase hooks the bar (a ~45 deg world-z yaw swings a finger behind it,
turning a slippy friction pinch into form closure) and drags the handle along
its hinge arc. See the surrounding comments for the why behind each trick.

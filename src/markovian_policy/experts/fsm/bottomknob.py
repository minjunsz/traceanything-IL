"""Bottomknob subtask: grasp the lower-left stove knob and turn it ~90 deg.

Phases (each entered purely from the current obs, so the FSM is Markovian):
    move-to-pre-grasp -> move-to-grasp -> grasp -> rotate -> release
    -> return-to-home

Structurally identical to the topknob (see topknob.py): "knob 2" is the same
vertical-bar stove knob, just lower on the panel, rotating about the *world -y
axis*. `knob_Joint_2` (qpos[11], range -1.57..0) is the turn angle and the D4RL
goal is -0.88 ("turned clockwise"). We side-grasp the bar (approach +world-y,
fingers along +-world-x) and, because the EE approach axis is collinear with the
knob axis, roll the wrist about world-y to turn it. The grasp point (knob2_site)
lies on the rotation axis, so it is rotation-invariant: the EE holds that point
and leads the current orientation a fixed roll each frame until the joint reaches
the goal.

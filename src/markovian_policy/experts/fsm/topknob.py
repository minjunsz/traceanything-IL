"""Topknob subtask: grasp the upper-left stove knob and turn it ~90 deg.

Phases (each entered purely from the current obs, so the FSM is Markovian):
    move-to-pre-grasp -> move-to-grasp -> grasp -> rotate -> release
    -> post-release -> return-to-home

The knob ("knob 4") is a vertical bar handle on the oven panel that rotates about
the *world -y axis* (the axis points straight out toward the robot, like a real
stove knob); `knob_Joint_4` (qpos[15], range -1.57..0) is the turn angle and the
D4RL goal is -0.92 ("turned clockwise"). We side-grasp the bar exactly like the
microwave/light handles (approach +world-y, fingers opening along +-world-x),
then -- because the EE approach axis is collinear with the knob axis -- simply
*roll the wrist about world-y* to turn the knob. The grasp point (knob4_site)
lies on the rotation axis, so it is rotation-invariant: the EE just holds that
point and rolls, leading the current orientation a fixed step each frame (a
velocity-style turn) until the joint reaches the goal.

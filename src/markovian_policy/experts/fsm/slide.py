"""Slide subtask: grab the sliding cabinet door's vertical handle and slide it
to the right (along +world-x).

Phases (each entered purely from the current obs, so the FSM is Markovian):
    pre-pre-grasp -> pre-grasp -> grasp -> slide -> release -> post-release
    -> pre-return-to-home -> return-to-home

The door is a 1-DOF prismatic joint (`slidedoor_joint`, qpos[19], axis +world-x,
range 0..0.44; the D4RL goal is 0.37). We side-grasp the vertical handle post
exactly like the microwave/kettle handles (approach +world-y, fingers opening
along +-world-x). Once grasped we push the post a small bounded lead in +x each
step until the door is open. While sliding the gripper is yawed -45 deg about
world z, which eases the push.

pre-pre-grasp exists to dodge the hinge cabinet door: if the hinge subtask runs
before slide, its door can be swung open, sweeping through roughly the same
height band the slide handle sits in. Going straight from home to the (high)
pre-grasp pose cuts diagonally through that band and can clip the open door.
pre-pre-grasp instead squares up in x/y at the pre-grasp pose's column while
staying well below the door's swing band, then pre-grasp rises straight up
that column to the actual stand-off. It reaches the column in two stages --
rising straight up from home before sweeping sideways -- since cutting the x/y
and z move from home together swings the arm through its own base.

pre-return-to-home applies the same dodge in reverse on the way out: slide
finishes at the handle's high reach, inside the hinge door's swing band, so
heading straight home would sweep laterally through that band again. It first
descends straight down (same x/y) to home's height, then sweeps laterally to
home's x/y at that now-safe height, before handing off to the joint-space
return-to-home controller.

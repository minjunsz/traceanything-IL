"""Light subtask: grab the oven light switch's lever and flip it left.

Phases (each entered purely from the current obs, so the FSM is Markovian):
    move-to-pre-grasp -> move-to-grasp -> grasp -> flip -> release
    -> return-to-home

The switch is a small lever (a capsule) that pivots about a *vertical* (+world-z)
axis at the switch base; `lightswitch_joint` (qpos[17], range -0.7..0) is the flip
angle and the D4RL goal is -0.69 ("flipped left"). We side-grasp the lever tip
exactly like the microwave/kettle handles (approach +world-y, fingers opening
along +-world-x), then push the tip *tangentially* around its pivot -- the same
hinge-arc push microwave.py uses to open the door, only here the hinge axis is
vertical, so the lever swings horizontally toward -world-x. Reading the pivot's
anchor/axis live (joint_anchor_axis) makes the push a continuous "out -> arc".

"""Kettle subtask: pick the kettle up by its left handle post and place it on
the back burner.

Phases (each entered purely from the current obs, so the FSM is Markovian):
    pre-grasp -> grasp -> lift -> transport -> lower -> release -> post-release
    -> return-to-home

The kettle is a free body (a freejoint at qpos[23:30]); the goal is to move it to
the back-burner pose. We grasp the left handle post (a vertical bar, like the
microwave handle, with the same gripper orientation). Once grasped, the EE holds
the post rigidly, so to move the kettle by some displacement we simply command
the EE by that *same* displacement: target = ee + (kettle_desired - kettle_now).
